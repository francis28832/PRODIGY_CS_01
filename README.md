# Caesar Cipher

This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. This project supports both encryption and decryption.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts a message using a specified shift value.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts a message using the same shift value that was used for encryption.
- **Case sensitivity**: Preserves the case of the original letters.
- **Non-alphabetic characters**: Keeps spaces and punctuation unchanged.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x must be installed. You can check if Python is installed by running the following command:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
